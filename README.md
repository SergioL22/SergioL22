## About me
I'm a Master’s student pursuing a **Computer Science** degree at **UTRGV**, with a focus on data science and analytics. I enjoy working with datasets and ultimately aim to become a Data Scientist.

I'm particularly interested in extracting insights from messy data and building reproducible analyses, primarily using Python and SQL.

Outside of coding, I enjoy playing games and am an avid Formula 1 fan.

##  Currently
- Working on data analysis projects
- Practicing SQL and algorithmic problem solving
