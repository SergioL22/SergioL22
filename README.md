## About me
I'm a Master’s student pursuing a **Computer Science** degree at **UTRGV**. I enjoy working with datasets and ultimately aim to become a Data Scientist.
I’m particularly interested in extracting insights from messy data and building reproducible analyses.
Outside of coding, I enjoy playing games and am an avid Formula 1 fan.
